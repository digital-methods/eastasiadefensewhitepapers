## Republic of Korea 2006-2010 vs. 2011-2016

### 2006-2010
From 2006 to 2010 the Republic of Korea put an emphasis on reconciliation and deplomacy, as evident from the dark green cluster. Although it is connected to the yellow cluster, containing strategic considerations, there is also a concetion with the light green cluster of economic cooperation present.

### 2011-2016
In this network the emphasis with regard to North Korea is split and on the one hand lies on the military threat the country poses, as observable in the yellow cluster, which contains both the term "north korean aggression" and "tailored deterrence strategy" as well as "wmd threats". On the other hand there is still a diplomatic and civilian element present, which is located in the red cluster. This cluster contains terms such as "separated families".

### Conclusion

In conclusion, one can observe that a change in threat perception has occured between the two time slices. While in the former one the North was seen more as a diplomatic challange the latter indicates that military and strategic considerations have now taken over, possibly due to the DPRK's increased nuclear capability. 
No evidence of terms refering to the PRC was found. 

## Japan 2005-2010 vs. 2011-2017

### 2005-2010

The clusters produced by this co-occurence matrix are dominated by the large, central, green cluster. It contains the node for the term "North Korea" and several others that are linked to its proliferation efforts. The node is connected the purpel defense policy cluster and more deplomacy related nodes such as "six-party talks" as well as a small cluster representing changes in the security environment. Hence, it becomes clear that the DPRK took up a central role in Japanese defence considerations in this period of time.

### 2011-2017

As in the earlier time slice, the matrix is dominated by the dark green cluster. This time, however, a smaller bright green cluster, dedicated to the Korean penisuala, containing North Korea is obersvable. It is also important to emphasise that the node "chinese navy" in the light green cluster indicates that, although still not central to Japanese conisderations, the PRC's growing power has been recognised in this period of time.

### Conclusion

In a nutshell, the perception of North Korea as a threat seems to be more central in the first five years of the analysis. However, both matrices show clearly that Japan devotes major resources towards mitigating this threat. Surprisingly, the term "china" did not appear in the martix, however a reference to its navy can be found in the latter time slice. An explainaition for this might be the incident at the senkaku/diaoyu islands, which turned relations between the two countries sour.
