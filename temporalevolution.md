# Temporal Evolution

## Republic of Korea

What can be seen in the case of ROK is an increased emphasis on the international collaboration over time â€“ with higher frequencies of terms related to the UN Security Council, Defense Cooperation, Enforcement, Decrees, and the International Community. There are increased mentions os ballistic missiles and North Korea, yet terms such as Nuclear test and Nuclear weapons have remained farily consistent over the past decade, as have other, more charged terms such as Readiness posture.

## Japan

Regarding Japan most improtant terms such as "North Korea", "Security Envrionment" or "ballistic missile" have stayed rather consistent. Evenethough, the former term had a higher significance in the mid 2000s, the fluctiation abosvered is minimal and can therefor not be used to draw meaningful a conclusion.

## Australia 

In the case of Australia, an increase in the use of term "United States" can be observed over time hinting at rising reliance on the United States. Furthermore, the term "security environment" has increased in significanc in the last edition of the defence white paper. This is likely caused by changes in the way the Australian administration views the situation in its immideate to medium ranged neigbourhood. Combined with a higher frequency of the use of the term "maritime security" growing concerns over the situation in the South China Sea appear to be a likely explaination for this change.
