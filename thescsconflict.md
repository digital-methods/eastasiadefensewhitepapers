# The South China Sea Conflict

## History of the Conflict

As the conflict in the South China Sea (SCS) intensifies with the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) militarising the artificial islands it created and claimed in earlier phases of its island building project, elements in Japanese the government openly call for a reinterpretation of its pacifist constitution. But Japan is not alone in the endeavour to adapt its security strategy to a changing environment and mounting threat levels.

In an exemplary effort to elucidate the historical importance of the conflict(s) in question, let us first consider the historical background and strategic positions of Japan and South Korea vis-à-vis China and North Korea.

### Japan

As an island nation with few resources, Sea Lines of Communication (SLOCs) are of critical importance to Japanese national security. Nevertheless, Japan has played a minor role in the South China Sea after the end of the cold war, during which it had built several submarine bases in the region. Even when tensions rose between the Philippines, Vietnam and China in the 1990ies no major steps were taken to re-establish security. Although the Japanese state has not recognised the SCS as a major security concern in the 20 or so years after the cold war, it has, in 1981, pledged to militarily secure its SLOCs up to 1000 nautical miles from its capital Tokyo. 

This zone, however, does not encompass the SCS (Midford, 2015, pp. 525-526; Storey, 2013, pp. 142-143). As the DPRK became a primary national security concern in the 1990ies, the focus in the Japanese security community turned towards communist Korea and therefore away from Chinese claims in the region. As the PRC took the Mischief Reef from the Philippines, labelled as a significant incident by most actors in the area, the EASR a journal published by the National Institute Defense Studies, a government controlled organisation, only mentioned China as “establishing a foothold in the Spratlys” (Storey, 2013, p. 144). In the mid and 2000s white papers issued by the government referred to the South China Sea as one among several factors which cause uncertainty in the region. 

This however changed radically, when an incident in the EEZ of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, in 2010, led to a marked cooling in Sino-Japanese relations. Following this incident, concerns arose about a connection between the Chinese approach towards the South and East China Sea. (Storey, 2013, pp. 144-146). In 2013 the Chinese government started the island-building process in the South China Sea. It has constructed runways and other military facilities on three of these newly established bastions, the Fiery Cross Reef, the Subi Reef and the Mischief Reef. A number of other reefs that offer the potential for island-building processes would allow for a Chinese air defence identification zone for the former artificial islands to be established, shifting the power balance in the region. 

Koda argues that if the PRC were to build an island on Scarborough Shoal, the Chinese would be able to establish a strategic triangle between Woody Island, the Spratlys and the aforementioned Shoal that spans most of the region thereby creating a powerful threat to the freedom of navigation and subsequently Japanese SLOCs in the South China Sea (Koda, 2016, pp. 29-30). The threat perception and its implications for Japanese security strategy are best captured by Lee quoting Bjørn Grønning as: “[s]hifting distribution of capabilities in China’s favour and perceived Chinese aggressiveness in the maritime domain, among other factor, meant that it had to augment its security by modernizing its own forces, strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance, and expanding security cooperation with key likeminded
state such as Australia and India that also had vested interest in balancing China.” (Bjørn Grønningen quoted by Lee, 2016, p. 210).

### South Korea

The South Korean security interest and strategy are based on economic considerations, even more so than Japan’s. This is most visible in the fact that trade has expanded significantly over the last two decades, creating interdependence between the two countries. Contrary to Japan, South Korean efforts to counterbalance rising Chinese economic and military as well as political power in the regions have been minimal and largely reactive this can be explained by three key factors. 

First, most of the ROK's security strategy centres around the alliance with the U.S.A, which allows the country to interact and even tighten relations with PRC without fear of being overtaken by the potential adversary. This means that although the People's Republic of China is seen as a threat, economic ties can still be deepened, advancing South Korean growth. Kim goes even further arguing that: “Under these circumstances, Seoul is rather encouraged to deepen its ties with Beijing in order to reap economic and diplomatic gains” (Kim, 2016, p. 720). 

Second, the PRC’s rise in economic power has been a positive factor in South Korean economic growth rather than a threat. This is clearly reflected the country’s trade surplus with China in the period from 1992 to 2010, which totalled at 217.6 billion USD and trade between the two nations has increased 24 fold in the same period. This interdependence can be seen as a discouraging factor for taking action to rebalance against the Middle Kingdom (Kim, 2016, pp. 719-721). Regarding its core strategic interest, North Korea rather than China represents the major security concern to the Republic of Korea. The PRC is still considered an asset in keeping the peace on the Korean peninsula by the PRC's leadership. This is due to the fact that officials in Seoul believe that stability on between the Korean adversaries is of vital interest to China's economy, which ensures the legitimacy of the Chines Communist Party. 

Therefore, strengthening relations with a potential enemy in this scenario, which could lead to a loss in relative power, is outweighed by the danger of escalation with neighbouring North Korea (Kim, 2016, p. 721; Wong, 2015, p. 1246).

Katagiri, & Nori. (2015), have written about the conflict from a strategic perspective, explaining the implications for the Japanese and South Korean security environment, while Chung Min Lee (2016) has dedicated some chapters to the reasons for these “fault lines” and their implications, in his more general book on Asian relations. Though the focus on security is a shared attribute of their works, their approaches differ significantly. 

Audrey Y. Wong’s work uses a historical perspective to describe the rising tensions in the South and East China Sea and Japan’s and South Korea’s security strategy, relying mainly on government documents, while Sebastian Maslow focuses on public opinion and institutions and Katagiri writes about the strategies and outcome of the U.S. and its allies on the one side and the PRC on the other.
