# Cross-regional Network Mapping

## Republic of Korea

The co-occurrence network produced, has 8 clusters that are connected to each other mostly through the central two (blue and green).
North Korea is central in ROKâ€™s defense landscape. This can be observed by looking at three out of four of the bottom right clusters, dedicated to North Korea and stability on the peninsula. While the lower left one represents strategies involving the international community and weapons systems deemed a threat to the south, its neighbour is dedicated to civilian and bilateral diplomatic activities such as inter-Korean exchanges. The big blue cluster above is less explicit, though, it involves strategic consideration and South Korea's key partners.
Surprisingly, given the ROK's closeness to China, there are no terms found in the co-occurrence matrix that indicate primary consideration concerning this rising power in its neighbourhood.

## Japan

For the case of Japan, eight co-occurrence clusters were produced, although only six of them contain a large body of interconnected nodes. Most relevant to the analysis are the two blue, the red and the green cluster. The two blue ones are divided into material capabilities (dark blue) and policy instruments (light blue) and are connected to the red cluster, which is dominated by threats to the Japanese security environment. Hence, North Korea being central to the red cluster shows its importance for both military capabilities (deterrence) and policy instruments to mitigate its influence. The green group, on the other hand, contains the decision making bodies responsible for dealing with threats such as North Korea. It is therefore also well connected to the red cluster. Furthermore, no reference to the PRC could be found.

## Australia

The Australian case has also led to the production of an eight cluster network. Resembling the Japanese one, only seven of these are significant and well-connected enough to be of value in the analysis. 
Unexpectedly, although a cluster dealing with the security environment is present, none of the clusters contains a direct reference to either the People's Republic of China or the DPRK. Hence, it appears that Australia has been less concerned about the two countries in the last decade than the two others.
